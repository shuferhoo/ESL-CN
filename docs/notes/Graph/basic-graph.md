## Decomposable graphs

!!! note "Definition:"
    If a cycle $\alpha = \alpha_0,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n=\alpha$ has adjacent elements $\alpha_i\sim \alpha_j$ with $j\in \{i-1,i+1\}$, then it is said to havd a chord. If it has no chords it is said to be chordless. A graph is decomposable (or triangulated) if it contains no **chordless** cycles of length $\ge 4$.
